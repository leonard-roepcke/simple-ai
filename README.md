# simple-ai

**simple-ai** is a small console-based Python experiment that simulates **evolutionary learning** without using matrices or external libraries.
It evolves small neural-like structures through mutation and selection, improving their performance generation by generation.

## üå± Overview

This project demonstrates how simple evolutionary principles can be applied to improve an algorithm over time.
Each generation:

1. Several candidates are mutated versions of the current best.
2. All candidates are tested against the given problem.
3. The best-performing one "survives" and reproduces for the next generation.

There are no fancy optimizations ‚Äî everything is handled with pure Python lists and loops, so the process is intentionally slow but easy to understand.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Run the program from the console:

```bash
python main.py
```

All key parameters (mutation rate, spread, number of hidden layers, etc.) can be found and modified directly inside `main.py`.

## üß† Concept

Instead of gradient descent or backpropagation, this program uses **evolution**:

* Random mutations explore the search space.
* A simple selection rule keeps only the best individual each generation.
* Over time, the population ‚Äúlearns‚Äù to perform better on the task.

This approach is inspired by **genetic algorithms** and **neuroevolution**, but implemented in a very minimal way.

## üîç Notes

* Written in **pure Python 3** (only import Math for rounding).
* Designed for experimentation and learning, not performance.
* Ideal for understanding how mutation and selection can replace traditional neural training methods.

---

## üß© Future Ideas

* Add matrix operations (NumPy) for speed.
* Introduce problems linke ping pong.
* Implement visualization of progress over generations.
